Set up webpack for server
where do I store it/ aka what is the standard file name
create my server using express
create main app component
create board componenet
each box has to have an onclick function
so first set up a handle click function
handleClick function not working
did I pass it down correctly?
did I set it correctly on each row?
did I write the function correctly?
